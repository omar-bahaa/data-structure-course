This repository contains 2 project I made in the Data Structure Course in my university.

## Project 1

This project is an implementation, in python, of the following

  1. Circular double-ended Queue (Deque) supporting the following
    
    * `CircularDeque(capacity)` Constructor, set the maximum size of the deque to be capacity.
    
    * `insertFront()` Adds an item at the front of Deque. Return true if the operation is successful.
    
    * `insertRear()` Adds an item at the rear of Deque. Return true if the operation is successful.
    
    * `deleteFront()` Deletes an item from the front of Deque. Return true if the operation is successful.
    
    * `deleteRear()` Deletes an item from the rear of Deque. Return true if the operation is successful.
    
    * `getFront()` Gets the front item from the Deque. If the deque is empty, return `None`.
    
    * `getRear()` Gets the last item from Deque. If the deque is empty, return `None`.
    
    * `isEmpty()` Checks whether Deque is empty or not. 
    
    * `isFull()` Checks whether Deque is full or not.
    
  2. AVL Tree (a self-balancing binary search tree in which each node maintains extra information called a balance factor whose value is either -1, 0 or +1. AVL tree got its name after its inventors Georgy Adelson-Velsky and Landis)
  
  3. Breadth First Traversal of AVL Tree using Circular Deque


## Project 2

A simplified social network that relies heavily on using different data structures. An idea adapted from [LeetCode's Design Twitter Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-twitter/).
